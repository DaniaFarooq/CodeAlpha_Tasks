# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification
## 📋 Project Overview
A machine learning classification model that identifies Iris flower species with 96.67% accuracy using morphological measurements. Demonstrates complete ML workflow from EDA to deployment.

## 📊 Dataset Features
150 samples across 3 species: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

4 measurements: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width

Perfectly balanced classes for reliable training

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

Train-Test Split: 80-20

Validation: Stratified sampling

Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## 📈 Results & Performance
### Model Metrics

Accuracy: 96.67%

Precision: 0.97 (Macro Avg)

Recall: 0.97 (Macro Avg)

F1-Score: 0.97 (Macro Avg)

### Feature Importance
